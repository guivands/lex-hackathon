                        I finally made it. I found out how to travel in time. Everybody laughed at me. Told me I was crazy, but I made it.

                        Edgar was the first. I'm sure about it.

                        It’s not just the well-known circumstances of his life — orphaned at birth, father of the mystery novel, master of cryptology, maestro of the macabre. Nor am I referring to the head-scratching details of his death, how he was found in a gutter wearing someone else’s clothes, babbling incoherently about an unidentified man named “Reynolds.” And I won’t even get into the confounding reports of a nameless figure who, for seven decades, would show up to Poe’s gravesite on the early hours of his birthday, dressed in black with a glass of cognac and three roses.

                        Curious and tragic, yes, but hardly evidence that the acclaimed horror writer could transcend the limits of space and time. No, my time travel theory concerns the author’s creative output, which you’ll soon see is so flukishly prophetic as to make my outlandish claim true.

                        Written in 1837, Poe’s only completed novel details a mutiny on a whaling ship lost at sea. Out of supplies, the men revert to cannibalism, drawing straws to elect a sacrifice. A boy named Richard Parker draws the shortest straw and is subsequently eaten.

                        In 1884, forty-six years later after the novel’s publication, four men would be set adrift following the sinking of their yacht. Shipwrecked and without food, they too would go the survival cannibalism route, electing to kill and eat a 17-year-old cabin boy. The boy’s name: Richard Parker.

                        The extraordinary parallel went unnoticed for nearly a century, until a widely-circulated letter from a descendant of the real Parker outlined the similarities between the novel’s scene and the actual event.

                        The key to his technique was hidden at plain sight, in one of his poems. I always knew that there was something odd about those bells.

                        I'm writting this before my first experiment as a precaution. If something goes wrong... at least my discovery is written for future generations.

                        Here I go. To new possibilities. To new horizons.
